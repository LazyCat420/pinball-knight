# Status board

The living broken / fixed / working record. **Update this page in the same PR
as the change it records.** Newest entries first within each section.

## Working

- **2026-08-09 — Extraction complete.** 870 commits filtered from
  braindeadbot-client (paths `src/objects/dungeon-game` → `src/scenes/dungeon`
  → `src/game/pinball-knight`, plus tavern, forge surface, net/services/utils
  deps, scripts, docs) into `legacy/`, pushed as `main`. `git log --follow`
  reaches file births.
- **2026-08-09 — Legacy oracle green standalone.** `cd legacy && npm ci &&
  npm test`: 246 files / 2,649 tests passed (131 s, metered through
  `scripts/ops/pk-run.sh`).
- **2026-08-09 — Workspace scaffold.** pk-core / pk-assets / pk-audio /
  pk-game / xtask compile; `Mulberry32` ported and pinned bit-exact against the
  JS oracle (5 seeds × 5 draws); `pk-assets` parses all 19+ published sprite
  manifests.

## Broken / not started

- `cargo xtask bake` — stub. M0's real exit criterion (baked knight frame on
  screen) is open.
- `cargo xtask dist` — stub (wasm-bindgen/wasm-opt/brotli pipeline not built;
  trunk not yet installed on the box).
- pk-game renders nothing yet (bevy core only; render features land in M1 —
  see the comment in `crates/pk-game/Cargo.toml` for the planned feature set).
- CI (GitHub Actions) not set up: fmt/clippy/test + wasm build + size check +
  legacy vitest job all pending.
- Legacy `/forge` UI + `next dev` not yet smoke-tested from the new location
  (vitest suite is green; the dev-server path needs one manual run).

## Fixed

*(nothing yet — entries move here from Broken with the commit that fixed them)*

## Known environment facts (not bugs)

- The legacy suite must run from `legacy/` (paths resolve relative to it).
- Test/browser runs are metered — the box is shared. See
  [Dev environment](../reference/dev-env.md).
