# Incidents

Diagnoses that outlive their patches. Write the reasoning, not just the fix.

## Inherited from the TS era (so the port doesn't relive them)

- **2026-08-08 — "A port that deletes ships green."** A sub-phase 6/7 "native
  WebGPU" conversion in braindeadbot-client deleted the renderer and room art
  it claimed to port; new tests certified the stubs; it shipped live and was
  reverted (`7937bfe`). Lesson for THIS port: parity fixtures against the
  legacy oracle, in the same PR as the ported code — a green suite over stubs
  proves nothing unless the suite is the oracle's.
- **Inbox sidecar vs published manifest.** Two JSON shapes; conflating them
  fails silently (loader falls back to the painter with no error). `pk-assets`
  now owns both shapes in the type system.
- **WSL GPU mirages.** SwiftShader (headless) and WSLg/llvmpipe render
  wrong-perf truth; every GPU timing must come from Windows host Chrome or a
  host-native build.
